# automatic_billing
Reads billing data from an csv file and creates all corresponding bills. As an option, it can also send out all those bills to the specified email adresses. This project is a very simple, small proof of concept which can be improved and tailored to client requirements.
## How will this save your company time?
- Automatic pdf generation with no intermediate steps in word
- No manual data entry
- Support multiple services per client
- Automatic invoice number management
- Fully customizable HTML template ensures a professional appearance for the invoices
- Accurately calculates totals, integrating taxes, different rates for different works,...
- **Scalability**: Works just as well with 10 clients as with 10000
## Features
- Read client and service data from CSV files
- Generate professional PDFs for each client
- Use a customizable HTML template with placeholders
- Save PDF files in an output/ folder
- Send them to the email adresses in the client data file

## Technologies used
- **Python 3.8+:** for data processing and automation
- **jinja2:** to render HTML templates dynamically
- **pdfkit & wkhtmltopdf:** to convert HTML templates to PDF files
- **smtplib & email:** to create and send emails

## How it works
The workflow is very simple (keep in mind, this is a demo with only basic functions):
1) You provide your company info and client/service data in simple CSV files (see below for the example files)
2) Run the script
3) PDFs are automatically sent to clients and stored for your records

## File examples
This demo takes in one **company_data.csv** file of the form
<table>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>company name</strong></td>
        <td>Example LLC</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>street adress</strong></td>
        <td>Main street, 1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>zip code</strong></td>
        <td>100001</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>city</strong></td>
        <td>New York</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>company name</strong></td>
        <td>Example LLC</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>phone</strong></td>
        <td>123456789</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>email</strong></td>
        <td>company@example.com</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>last invoice number</strong></td>
        <td>0</td>
    </tr>
</table>

and one **clients_services.csv** file of the form

<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Date</th>
      <th>Client name</th>
      <th>Email</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Hours</th>
      <th>Rate</th>
      <th>Taxes</th>
      <th>Total</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>01/01/2026</td>
      <td>John Smith</td>
      <td>john.smith@examplemail.com</td>
      <td>Paint job</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>40</td>
      <td>21%</td>
      <td>193.6</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>02/01/2026</td>
      <td>Albert Williams</td>
      <td>a_will01@examplemail.com</td>
      <td>Roofing job</td>
      <td>50</td>
      <td>35</td>
      <td>21%</td>
      <td>2117.5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>03/01/2026</td>
      <td>John Smith</td>
      <td>john.smith@examplemail.com</td>
      <td>Kitchen island placement</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>40</td>
      <td>21%</td>
      <td>96.8</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>04/01/2026</td>
      <td>Emily Watson</td>
      <td>emily.watson2@examplemail.com</td>
      <td>Security camera placement</td>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>30</td>
      <td></td>
      <td>120</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

and outputs invoices like this (it assembles all services supplied to one client on one invoice):

## Possible improvements
This being a very simple demo, a lot of features can be added to better tailor it to client needs:
- Adding a company logo to the invoices
- Improving the support for long invoices on several pages
- Adding different client categories and processing their billing differently
- Connecting script to acounting software or existing services database
- Adding an user-friendly interface
- Adding data processing features: finding invalid entries, flagging duplicates,...
- Reports creation: every time it runs, on top of sending the invoices, it also generates a report on the billings, with custom metrics, presentation-ready
- Use of email templates to send out better-looking, personalized emails
- ...
