# automatic_billing
Reads billing data from an csv file and creates all corresponding bills. As an option, it can also send out all those bills to the specified email adresses. This project is a very simple, small proof of concept which can be improved and tailored to client requirements.

## Technologies used
- **Python 3.8+:** for data processing and automation
- **jinja2:** to render HTML templates dynamically
- **pdfkit & wkhtmltopdf:** to convert HTML templates to PDF files

## How it works
The workflow is very simple (keep in mind, this is a demo with only basic functions):
1) You provide your company info and client/service data in simple CSV files (see below for the example files)
2) Run the script
3) PDFs are automatically sent to clients and stored for your records

## File examples
This demo takes in one **company_data.csv** file of the form
<table>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>company name</strong></td>
        <td>Example LLC</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>street adress</strong></td>
        <td>Main street, 1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
